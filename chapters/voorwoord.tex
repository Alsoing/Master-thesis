First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Peter Karsmakers, who has provided me with patient and meticulous guidance and valuable advice throughout the research process, enabling me to make continuous progress on the road of scientific research. Secondly, I would like to give special thanks to my senior Toon Vinck, who has not only provided me with many inspiring suggestions academically, but also given me a lot of support and encouragement in life.

At the same time, I am deeply grateful to KU Leuven for providing me with a high-quality academic environment and abundant resources, which have provided a solid backing for my research and studies. I would also like to thank my family, whose unconditional support and encouragement have always been my driving force. In addition, I would like to thank my girlfriend Hu Jinyu in particular for her caring attention to me outside of class time, which has always made me feel warmth and love amidst the busyness of my research.

Finally, I sincerely thank all those who have given me help and support over the past year. It is your care, guidance and encouragement that have enabled me to successfully complete this master's thesis.
